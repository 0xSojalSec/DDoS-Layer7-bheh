# What Is A DDos-Attack?

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable
by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources from banks to news websites or any kind of business, and present a major challenge to making sure people can publish and access important information and turning the site down, this way no transactions can be made for the time its being DDoSed.

This can be used also to test specific ports running on specific services, that could be vulnerable to DDoS attacks, especially when you find a valid vulnerable issue that can be exploited by such attacks.
